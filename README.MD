The game display's a RGB colour at the top of the page. The user should try to find the corresponding colour in as few clicks as possible.

There are 3 difficulties to choose from: Easy, medium and hard. Harder difficulties increase the amount of options to choose from

I made this game before starting the Flatiron bootcamp.

I followed a tutorial on how to make this, but added the third difficulty myself, having to change and add many lines of code.
